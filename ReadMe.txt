Involutionary
=============

Involutionary will be an application for drawing & animating various mathematical curves especially roulette curves including cycloids, hypotrochoids, epitrochoids, polytrochoids, and involutes.

It will be based on the experiments in my "Java Toys" repository involving drawing hypotrochoid curves (created by a circle rotating inside another circle)  and polytrochoids (created by multile nested circles rotating inside each other).
